    <h1>Jumbo Pumpkin Pie Pancake for One</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Like I said in the scrambled eggs recipe, I got that dietary restriction rizz. Greek yogurt is a quick and easy snack that keeps my blood sugar happy happy happy. This recipe is so delicious and easy to whip up, even if you don't know the difference between a doonk and a dash. Most of the time, however, I do just mix a little spoon of sugar-free jelly in my Greek yogurt. Come to find out that even natural fruit sugar makes my pancreas sad, so I'll be sticking to stevia from now on.</p>
