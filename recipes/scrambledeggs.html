    <h2>Scrambled eggs on a plate</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Three eggs</li>
        <li>1 Tbs of butter (more if you prefer)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the butter in a nonstick skillet and turn in on. While the butter is heating up, whisk the eggs in a bowl with a few pinches of salt.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are whisked, pour them into the pan. Stir constantly with a spatula. The eggs should absorb the butter.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are cooked to your liking, turn them out onto a plate. Add pepper if desired and enjoy.</li>
