    <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe everyone should know how to make. It's what I eat most mornings to keep my insulin resistance under control. Did you know you are most sensitive to insulin in the morning? If you have diabeties in your family or suspect you're on the way to Type 2 yourself, a high-protein and high-fat breakfast is the best way to start your day. Most breakfasts are loaded with carbs and sugar that wreak havoc on your blood sugar and make your pancreas cry tears of torment. Even if you don't have that diatary restriction rizz, eggs are a quick, delicious way to begin any morning.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Three eggs</li>
        <li>1 Tbs of butter (more if you prefer)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the butter in a nonstick skillet and turn in on. While the butter is heating up, whisk the eggs in a bowl with a few pinches of salt.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are whisked, pour them into the pan. Stir constantly with a spatula. The eggs should absorb the butter.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are cooked to your liking, turn them out onto a plate. Add pepper if desired and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
